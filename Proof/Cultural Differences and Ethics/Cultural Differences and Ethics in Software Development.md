- cultural differences between group members
    - different viewpoints and different ways of working. Agile is very useful to make it easier to work together (point to agile doc)
        - Differences in competences
        - Differences in behavior, one person is more persuasive and others could hold back a bit more, some disagree more often due to a different way of programming software
    - If people from much different cultures came together, working together could become more of a challenge, because the gaps between the above mentioned qualities could be very large between group members.
    - No matter what culture a person is part of, if they are used to working in Agile and have experience working in software teams, working in groups should be much more streamlined
- There are other things with regards to ethics in software development, such as how much data is collected in an application, or whether a (advanced) technical product will be beneficial for its users and perhaps the world. This could especially be said for AI
    - In our group project, the app might cause some people to lose their jobs. For the CEO's perspective however, this is very useful, because less money will have to be spent on employees
    - In my individual project, it is important to realize what kind of data should be available for all of the users of the website. I could, for example, like other chess tournament websites, show full names to every user in a player field when creating a tournament. I think this is bad design, because such data doesn't need to be available for every user. This could raise some ethical concerns.

I am thinking of briefly describing the ethical rules that people made instead of directly citing them like in here
I could perhaps compare these ethical rules to a probable project in the future that could raise ethical concerns
