Business Processes:

This will focus on my individual project.

In this document, I will describe potential monetization ideas for this project. It will focus on the viewpoint of different kinds of users and their interactions with the website. The type of users could be: An experienced chess arbiter who hosts tournaments often. Perhaps there could even be a business process where this website would work with FIDE and charge them a lot for it. Another type of user could be a somewhat new chess tournament hoster.

monetization ideas:

- You need to pay an amount of money per month to host more than 5 tournaments per month
- You need to pay to do more type of pairing systems. Such as double round robin (bad idea) or a certain type of swiss, or something else
- You need to pay for other type of point systems and tiebreakers.
- You need to pay for charging people to enter (public) tournaments.
