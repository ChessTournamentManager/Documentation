# Intro

This portfolio will guide you through several snippets of my work during the third software semester of FHICT (2022-2023). This repository will act as a summary of my work in this semester, along with explanations of how I proved a certain set of learning outcomes.

In this document, the learning outcomes are explained and links are provided to documents. Each of these documents contain parts of my work and explain how I've achieved a certain learning outcome. If you aren't interested in my proof and are only interested in design documents and features, go to the design document. The link to that is also in the grid below.

# Learning outcomes

# Proof

Below is a table containing all of my proof, with links which will take you to documents which will further explain how I've achieved the learning outcomes.
