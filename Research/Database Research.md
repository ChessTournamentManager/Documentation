# Introduction

For this project, I need to choose a suitable database for all of my services. Since all of my services work very similar, I only want to choose one type of database. I will then use multiple instances of that database type for my services.


# My Requirements

## The database needs to be fast

I want my website to be as responsive as possible. It would be a shame if I used a slow database while using such a fast module bundler like Vite. The database must also be able to scale well, in case many people use the website. This is not that much as a requirement though. It is more important that the database is fast than it is scalable.

## The database should be NoSQL

There are multiple reasons why I don't want to use a database with SQL. First of all, SQL databases are generally slower than NoSQL databases. According to a Rochester study, key-value storage databases are especially fast (https://www.cs.rochester.edu/courses/261/fall2017/termpaper/submissions/06/Paper.pdf). Furthermore, it is easier to do scaling when using NoSQL databases. When scaling with SQL databases, you have to migrate to a more expensive server (verticle scaling). When scaling with NoSQL databases, you can just add more cheaper servers (horizontal scaling) (https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained/nosql-vs-sql, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-vs-nosql-which-one-is-better-to-use/). Lastly, I want to use NoSQL, because I have never used a NoSQL database in an individual project before and I would like to gain more experience by using it in this project.


# Database Options

For my database options, I decided it would be good to pick different types of NoSQL databases, to test the theory that key-value databases are the fastest. I have also picked popular databases of each type, which are said to be very fast.

## Redis

**What type of database is Redis?**

Redis is a type of database known as a key-value database. In a key-value database, data is stored and retrieved using a unique key that identifies the particular item of data. The data (value) associated with a key can be any type of data, such as strings, integers, lists, dates, UUID's and more. Key-value databases are typically very fast and scalable, making them well-suited for applications that require quick access to large amounts of data.

*Data types in Redis*

**In what scenarios is Redis often used?**

Redis is a good option for applications which need to handle lots of small continuous reads and writes. It is more often used as a cache, but can also be used as a data store. It can also store data in-memory, which allows these actions to be done faster. It is also ideal for applications that donâ€™t require frequent updates or need to support complex queries.

Redis is often used for the following use-cases:

- Caching
- Chatting, messaging, and queues
- Gaming leaderboards
- Session store
- Rich media streaming
- Geospatial
- Machine Learning
- Real-time analytics
