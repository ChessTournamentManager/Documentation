# Introduction

## Research Purpose

This research serves the purpose of giving more insights about which databases are suitable database for a Spring Boot application. I have decided to start this research, I use Spring Boot services for my project, the Chess Tournament Manager.

## Research Questions

In this research, there is a main question which answer should be very clear at the end of this research:

***Which database performs the fastest for a Spring Boot application?***

Besides this main question, there are several sub-questions that should also be answered in this research:

1. What are the different types of NoSQL databases?
2. How can you use databases within a Spring Boot application?
3. How can you benchmark database performance in a Spring Boot application? 

# My Requirements

## The database needs to be fast

I want my website to be as responsive as possible. It would be a shame if I used a slow database while using such a fast module bundler like Vite for the Vue.js frontend. The database must also be able to scale well, in case many people use the website. This is not that much as a requirement though. It is more important that the database is fast than it is scalable.

## The database should be NoSQL

There are multiple reasons why I don't want to use a database with SQL. SQL databases seem to be generally slower than NoSQL databases. According to a [Rochester study](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/courses/261/fall2017/termpaper/submissions/06/Paper.pdf), key-value storage databases are especially fast. Furthermore, it is easier to do scaling when using NoSQL databases. When scaling with SQL databases, you have to migrate to a more expensive server (vertical scaling). When scaling with NoSQL databases, you can just add more cheaper servers (horizontal scaling) (https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained/nosql-vs-sql, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-vs-nosql-which-one-is-better-to-use/). Lastly, I want to use NoSQL, because I have never used a NoSQL database in an individual project before and I would like to gain more experience by using it in this project.

# What are the different types of NoSQL databases?

There are many different types of NoSQL databases. Four of them are very popular:

## Key-value stores

In a key-value store, data is stored and retrieved using a unique key that identifies the particular item of data. The data (value) associated with a key can be any type of data, such as strings, integers, lists, dates, UUID's and more. Key-value databases are typically very fast and scalable, making them well-suited for applications that require quick access to large amounts of data.

[![Redis data types](../Images/redis_data_types.png)](../Images/redis_data_types.png)

*Data types in key-value databases*

## Document databases

Document databases store and query data as JSON-like documents. The format of these documents is very similar to how objects look like within applications, which means less translation is needed to use data in an application. In document databases, it is usually also possible to perform document nesting.

[![Database Document Example](../Images/example-db-documents.png)](../Images/example-db-documents.png)

*Examples of documents stored in a document database*

## Column oriented databases

Column oriented databases, or wide-column databases, work similarly to relational databases. The difference is that because wide-column databases store data in columns instead of rows, less computation time is needed to perform specific queries due to how the data is loaded into memory. Another difference compared to row oriented databases, is that data in wide-column databases are much easier to distribute to different database instances, and thus to scale horizontally.

[![Row vs Column](../Images/row-vs-column.jpg)](../Images/row-vs-column.jpg)

*Row-oriented vs. column-oriented database*

## Graph databases

Graph databases are very different compared to other types of databases. They focus more on the relationship between data and specialize more in queries where relationships need to be found, rather than performing quick reads and writes. In my application, I do not need to perform such queries and would like to minimize relationships between data. Therefore, I will not be using and testing any graph databases in this research.

[![Graph Database Modeling Example](../Images/graph-data.png)](../Images/graph-data.png)

*An example of modeled data stored in a graph database*

# Database Options

For my database options, I decided it would be good to pick different types of NoSQL databases, to test the theory that key-value databases are the fastest. I have also picked popular databases of each type, which are said to be very fast.

## Redis
*Website: https://redis.com/*

**What is Redis?**

Redis is a key-value database. It is a good option for applications which need to handle lots of small continuous reads and writes. It is more often used as a cache, but can also be used as a data store. It can also store data in-memory, which allows these actions to be done faster. It is also ideal for applications that donâ€™t require frequent updates or need to support complex queries.

Redis is often used for the following use-cases:

- Caching
- Chatting, messaging, and queues
- Gaming leaderboards
- Session store
- Rich media streaming
- Geospatial
- Machine Learning
- Real-time analytics

For more information about these use-cases, go to [this page](https://aws.amazon.com/redis/#Popular_Redis_Use_Cases)

**How popular is Redis?**

Redis is widely used by developers. It is the 6th most popular database according to [db-engines.com](https://db-engines.com/en/system/Redis) and the most popular key-value store. Many cloud services such as AWS and Google Cloud provide Redis as a cloud service. There are also lots of articles and videos available online about Redis. 

**Which large companies use Redis?**

There are quite a few large companies using Redis. Here are a few:
- Twitter
- GitHub
- Snapchat
- StackOverflow

## MongoDB
*Website: https://www.mongodb.com/*

**What is MongoDB?**

MongoDB is a document database. It is often used applications where high flexibility and scalability is required. With MongoDB, it is easy to refactor documents in the database without having any database downtime. Developers also often use MongoDB when they need a solution for storing data that is nested and unsorted.

MongoDB is often used for the following use-cases:
- Big data
- Content management systems
- Customer analytics
- Real-time data integration

MongoDB is especially useful for big data. Its speed, non-relational structure and support for data analytics make it perfectly suited for handling big data.

**How popular is MongoDB?**

MongoDB is used by many developers. It is the 5th most popular database according to [db-engines.com](https://db-engines.com/en/system/MongoDB) and the most popular document store. MongoDB is also widely available on cloud services, such as AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. A lot of developers have posted videos and articles about using MongoDB.


**Which large companies use MongoDB?**

Some large companies using MongoDB are the following:
- Toyota
- Vodafone
- Forbes

## Cassandra
*Website: https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html*

**What is Apache Cassandra?**

Cassandra is a distributed NoSQL wide-column database. It is a database specialized in working with nodes. A single node represents a single instance of Cassandra. By adding more nodes in your system, you can increase the capacity and speed. This is why Cassandra is called a distributed database and why it works well with multiple machines. Redis and MongoDB have (sharded) clusters instead of nodes, which work similarly. However, the companies behind those two databases have put less emphasis on those features than the company behind Cassandra has put on using nodes.

Cassandra is used in applications where very fast writes are required and where data isn't updated often. These are some popular use-cases for Cassandra:

- Financial services and payments
- Messaging
- Transaction logging
- Tracking packages and orders

**How popular is Cassandra?**

There is a lot of information available about Cassandra and how to use it. It is the 12th most popular database according to [db-engines.com](https://db-engines.com/en/system/Cassandra) and is the most popular wide-column store. It is also available in many cloud services.

**Which large companies use Cassandra?**

Cassandra is used by some very large companies:

- Apple
- Instagram
- Uber
- Spotify
- Twitter
- eBay
- Netflix

## ScyllaDB
*Website: https://www.scylladb.com/*

**What is ScyllaDB?**

(In what scenarios is ScyllaDB often used?)

ScyllaDB is also a wide-column database. It is very similar to Cassandra, and ScyllaDB's creators are very open about their goal to make ScyllaDB replace Cassandra. Cassandra is written in Java, while ScyllaDB is written in C++. Due to ScyllaDB being written in a lower level language, it has the potential to be faster. In many articles comparing ScyllaDB to Cassandra, such as [this one](https://activewizards.com/blog/scylla-vs-cassandra/) and [this one](https://thenewstack.io/benchmarking-apache-cassandra-40-nodes-vs-scylladb-4-nodes/), this result can clearly be seen. ScyllaDB outpeforms Cassandra easily, even while having less nodes than Cassandra. ScyllaDB especially peforms better under high workloads.

Since ScyllaDB is a replacement for Cassandra, it has similar use cases. However, it is not necessary to worry about slow reads and updates. Therefore, ScyllaDB can be used for more things.

**How popular is ScyllaDB?**

At the moment, even though its performance is great, it is not a popular database. There aren't many resources available online about how to use it with other technologies and developers aren't talking much about how they are using ScyllaDB in their applications. It is the 77th most popular database according to [db-engines.com](https://db-engines.com/en/system/ScyllaDB) and is the 8th most popular wide-column store. It is still available to use on cloud services like AWS and Google Cloud, but it is clear that it is less used compared to other databases in this research.

**Which large companies use ScyllaDB?**

There are several large companies using ScyllaDB, such as:
- Discord
- Disney+Hotstar
- Zillow
- Comcast
- Expedia

# Implementation: How can you use databases within a Spring Boot application?

In this section I will show how to implement these databases to a Spring Boot project. The explanations will assume that there is already a basic API which can handle basic CRUD operations. 

## Dockerizing the Application

You can use docker to easily connect your application to a database. Docker is an open source software platform used for containerizing applicataions. Containers are basically very small virtual machines, which only contain an application and its dependencies. With docker, it's easy to run applications, because it is not necessary install all needed technologies and dependencies on your local machine. It is also very easy to use databases with docker. Usually, all you need to do is specify which database you want to use by mentioning an existing docker image. A docker image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a docker container. After you have installed docker on your machine by following [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), you can specify a docker image to pull in a command, or through a docker compose file. We will be using a docker compose file in this guide.

Because we will be using docker, we will also be containerizing our backend service. We will use a docker compose file for telling docker which containers to create. The compose file will point towards a docker file, which contains the specific instructions for containerizing an application. This is a simple docker file I use for each of my services:

```docker
FROM maven:3.8.6-openjdk-18-slim

ADD target/myApp.jar myApp.jar
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/myApp.jar"]
```

When the instructions in this file are followed when building a container, the maven docker image of the specified version will be pulled and the build from myApp will be added to that image. Then, port 8080 will be configured to be accesible from outside the container and myApp will be run as an executable.

I will show a possible docker compose file at the start of each database implementation explanation, because I am assuming you only want to implement a single database for your application. If you want to see my full docker compose file for my project, go [here](https://github.com/ChessTournamentManager/.github/blob/main/docker-compose.yml).

## Redis Implementation

Add this docker compose file to root directory of your application, where your dockerfile is also located. Give your services and volume a fitting name.
```yml
version: "3.9"

services:
  tournament-svc:
    container_name: tournament-svc
    depends_on:
      - tournament-db-redis
    image: tournament-svc
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    restart: on-failure
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
  tournament-db-redis:
    container_name: tournament-db-redis
    restart: always
    image: redis:7.0.5-alpine
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
    expose:
      - "6379"
    volumes:
      - tournament-db-volume:/var/lib/tournament-db-redis

volumes:
  tournament-db-volume:
```

When this file is run, containers will be made of your application and a Redis instance. At the end of this implementation guide, they should be able to communicate with each other.

Then add these dependencies by putting them in the pom.xml file and then reload the project.
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-redis</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.lettuce</groupId>
  <artifactId>lettuce-core</artifactId>
  <version>6.2.1.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
```

Then add the `@RedisHash` bean to your domain class, and give the hash a name that fits. Then, implement the Serializable class, so that objects of the domain class can be serialized and deserialized by Redis.
```java
// More imports
import org.springframework.data.redis.core.RedisHash;

@RedisHash("Tournament")
public class Tournament implements Serializable {

    @Serial
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 6828938851562689867L;

    // Public enum Status

    @Id
    private UUID id;

    // More properties & constructors, getters and setters.
}
```

After that, go to your repository and make sure it extends the `CrudRepository` class. Then tell this class what type of model it should do CRUD operations with. Also tell it what type of object the primary key in that model is.
```java
// Imports

@Repository
public interface TournamentRepository extends CrudRepository<Tournament, UUID> {

}
```

Then add this configuration class to your project. This configuration class is responsible for connecting with the installed Redis database and serializing domain classes. In this configuration, transactions are enabled.
```java
// Imports

@Configuration
@EnableCaching
@EnableRedisRepositories
public class MainConfiguration {

    @Value("${redis.host}")
    private String redisHostName;

    @Value("${redis.port}")
    private Integer redisPort;

    @Bean
    public LettuceConnectionFactory redisLettuceConnectionFactory() {
        RedisStandaloneConfiguration redisStandaloneConfiguration = new RedisStandaloneConfiguration(redisHostName, redisPort);
        return new LettuceConnectionFactory(redisStandaloneConfiguration);
    }

    @Bean
    public RedisTemplate<byte[], byte[]> redisTemplate() {
        RedisTemplate<byte[], byte[]> redisTemplate = new RedisTemplate<>();
        redisTemplate.setConnectionFactory(redisLettuceConnectionFactory());
        redisTemplate.setKeySerializer(new StringRedisSerializer());
        redisTemplate.setHashKeySerializer(new StringRedisSerializer());
        redisTemplate.setHashKeySerializer(new JdkSerializationRedisSerializer());
        redisTemplate.setValueSerializer(new JdkSerializationRedisSerializer());
        redisTemplate.setEnableTransactionSupport(true);
        redisTemplate.afterPropertiesSet();
        return redisTemplate;
    }
}
```

Lastly, put these environment variables in your application.properties file. It is important to note that the value of `redis.host`, which is `tournament-db-redis`, aligns with the name of the docker container that I will be using that contains a redis instance.
```
redis.host=tournament-db-redis
redis.port=6379
```

Run this command to spin up your containers:
```shell
docker compose up -d --build
```

Now, the application should be able to write data into the Redis instance. To test this, you can make a POST request to your API.

[![Tournament post request](../Images/postman_post_tournament.png)](../Images/postman_post_tournament.png)

*When making a post request, there is a response from the API.*

Then, we can go into Redis and check if the posted object is saved as intended. You could check this by using the redis-cli, but I prefer using the RedisInsight GUI.

[![Tournament saved in Redis](../Images/redisinsight.png)](../Images/redisinsight.png)

*The posted tournament within Redis.*

As you can see, the posted tournament has succesfully been saved in the database. We can also make a GET request to confirm this.

[![Tournament get request](../Images/postman_get_tournament.png)](..Images/postman_get_tournament.png)

*Response contains the new tournament*

## MongoDB Implementation

Add this docker compose file to root directory of your application, where your dockerfile is also located. Give your services and volume a fitting name, configure the correct application port and add your chosen username and password. You could also point to an env file instead of storing them directly in your docker compose file.
```yml
version: "3.9"

services:
  player-svc:
    container_name: player-svc
    depends_on:
      - player-db-mongo
    image: player-svc
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    restart: on-failure
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
  player-db-mongo:
    container_name: player-db-mongo
    restart: always
    image: mongo:5.0.14
    environment:
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
    ports:
      - 27017:27017
    expose:
      - 27017
    volumes:
      - player-db-volume:/var/lib/player-db-mongo

volumes:
  player-db-mongo:
```

When this file is run, containers will be made of your application and a Mongo instance. At the end of this implementation guide, they should be able to communicate with each other.

Then install this dependency for your project.
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Then go to your model and put the `@Document` annotation above your domain class. This way, the application knows you are trying to use MongoDB's repository, instead of the JPARepository. You can also include the `@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)` annotation to tell the application to remove `null` fields when serializing the class.
```java
// Imports

@Document(collection = "player")
@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)
public class Player {

    // Public static final fields

    @Id
    private UUID id;

    // More properties & constructors, getters and setters.
}
```

In your repository, extend the MongoRepository and insert the domain model class and the type of ID that it has.
```java
// More imports

import org.springframework.data.mongodb.repository.MongoRepository;

@Repository
public interface PlayerRepository extends MongoRepository<Player, UUID> {
}
```

In your application.properties, add these properties and rename some values to something more secure. Again, `player-db-mongo` is referring to a docker container name.
```
spring.data.mongodb.host=player-db-mongo
spring.data.mongodb.authentication-database=admin
spring.data.mongodb.username=admin
spring.data.mongodb.password=password
spring.data.mongodb.database=Player
spring.data.mongodb.port=27017
```

Run this command to spin up your containers:
```shell
docker compose up -d --build
```

The application should be able to write data into the MongoDB database.

[![Player post request](../Images/postman_post_player.png)](../Images/postman_post_player.png)

*The response from the API.*

Then, we can go into MongoDB and check if the posted object is saved as intended. I'm using the GUI application called MongoDB Compass to do this.

[![Player saved in MongoDB](../Images/mongodbcompass.png)](../Images/mongodbcompass.png)

*The posted player within MongoDB.*

The player has been saved succesfully. Let's make a GET request.

[![Player get request](../Images/postman_get_player.png)](..Images/postman_get_player.png)

*Response contains the new player*

## ScyllaDB Implementation

Add this docker compose file to root directory of your application, where your dockerfile is also located. Give your services and volume a fitting name and configure the correct application port.
```yml
version: "3.9"

services:
  rank-svc:
    container_name: rank-svc
    depends_on: 
      - rank-db-scylla
    image: rank-svc
    build:
      context: ./rank-svc
      dockerfile: /Dockerfile
    restart: on-failure
    ports:
      - 8082:8082
  rank-db-scylla:
    container_name: rank-db-scylla
    restart: always
    image: scylladb/scylla:latest
    ports:
      - 9042:9042
    expose:
      - 9042
    volumes:
      - rank-db-volume:/var/lib/rank-db-scylla

volumes:
  rank-db-scylla:
```

When this file is run, containers will be made of your application and a ScyllaDB instance.

Then install these dependencies in your project. With the spring-data-cossandra dependency, you can use the cassandra repositories and connect with a cassandra database. These things will also be useful with the ScyllaDB database. The java-driver-core dependency will allow Java data to be inserted in a ScyllaDB database.
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-cassandra</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.scylladb</groupId>
  <artifactId>java-driver-core</artifactId>
  <version>4.14.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Add the `@Table` and `@PrimaryKey` annotations in your domain class. You can also add the `@Column` annotation to give properties a different name in the database table. In this case, I renamed them because capital letters are automatically lowercased in the database. I like using `snake_case`.
```java
// Imports

@Table(value = "rank")
public class Rank {
    private static final short DEFAULT_RANK_NUMBER = 1;

    @PrimaryKey
    private UUID id;
    @Column("tournament_id")
    private UUID tournamentId;
    @Column("player_id")
    private UUID playerId;
    @Column("rank_number")
    private short rankNumber;
    @Column("points")
    private float points;
    @Column("created_at")
    private LocalDateTime createdAt;

    // Constructors, getters and setters
}
```
In your repository, extend the CassandraRepository and insert the domain model class and the type of ID that it has.
```java
// More imports

import org.springframework.data.cassandra.repository.CassandraRepository;

public interface RankRepository extends CassandraRepository<Rank, UUID> {
}
```

Then add this configuration class to your project. This configuration class is responsible for connecting with ScyllaDB. In this class, it is mentioned that a keyspace in ScyllaDB will be created, if it doesn't already exist. This is very useful, because this will eliminate the need to enter the database and manually create a keyspace.
```java
// Imports

@Configuration
@EnableCassandraRepositories
public class ScyllaConfiguration extends AbstractCassandraConfiguration {

    @Value("${scylla.keyspace}")
    private String keyspace;

    @Override
    protected String getKeyspaceName() {
        return keyspace;
    }

    @Override
    protected List<CreateKeyspaceSpecification> getKeyspaceCreations() {
        final CreateKeyspaceSpecification specification =
                CreateKeyspaceSpecification.createKeyspace(keyspace)
                        .ifNotExists()
                        .with(KeyspaceOption.DURABLE_WRITES, true)
                        .withSimpleReplication();
        return List.of(specification);
    }
}
```

These are the properties and values used for this implementation. As you can see, a schema will also be created if it doesn't already exist.
```
spring.data.cassandra.contact-points=localhost
spring.data.cassandra.port=9042
spring.data.cassandra.local-datacenter=datacenter1
spring.data.cassandra.schema-action=create_if_not_exists
spring.data.cassandra.keyspace-name=rankKeyspace
scylla.keyspace=rankKeyspace
```

Run this command to spin up your containers:
```shell
docker compose up -d --build
```

At this point, I expected the the service to work and connect with the database. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case:

[![Rank error logs](../Images/rank_error_logs.png)](../Images/rank_error_logs.png)

In these error logs, the rank service that uses ScyllaDB says that it cannot reach any valid contact point and tells me to make sure I have provided valid addresses. You can see that it thinks the address I have provided was `localhost/<unresolved>:9042`. The `unresolved` part is strange. There is also another large problem. When you are building an application, it should not depend on a database to start running. It should have a mocked database and should run tests without depending on a real database. I have decided not to fix this issue, because it will take too much time to do so. Instead, I will be using a mongo or redis instance for my rank service. This also means that for the upcoming benchmark tests, I will only be testing the Redis and MongoDB instances.

# Benchmarking: How can you benchmark database performance in a Spring Boot application? 

For benchmarking Redis and MongoDB, I have created two more Spring Boot projects, which are located in [this](https://github.com/ChessTournamentManager/Research-Benchmarks) repository. The repository also contains a docker compose file, which is used to get instances of Redis and MongoDB to run.

In the Spring Boot projects, there will be benchmark tests with Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH) and JUnit5. Each of the projects has a Research domain class and a ResearchRepository. Since we are testing the databases, we need to use the ResearchRepository in our tests. By using JMH within the testing framework of Spring Boot, it is possible to start the application context, which means the ResearchRepository can be autowired. This is extremely important.

In the tests, we will attempt to find out what the read and write speeds of the two databases are. To find this out, we will write tests where the application will only access a mocked repository and a test where the application accesses the real repository and uses a database. We can then calucate the read and write speeds of the database. I will also write tests where only an object is created and where a variable is accessed, just to see how the time it takes to do that compares with the other tests.

The reason why I made seperate projects instead of including the benchmark tests in my existing services, is because those tests are not related to main functionality of my application. If I had included them, they would run whenever a new build of the service is made, which would be a waste of time and resources. I would have needed to find a way to exclude those specific tests when I run a build, which would cost more time to figure out than if I had just created new projects.

With that said, let's see how to write benchmark tests in Spring Boot.

## Benchmark Testing With JMH in Spring Boot

To use JMH in Spring Boot, add these dependencies in your pom.xml.
```xml
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.openjdk.jmh/jmh-core -->

(write comments that explain the code, and also put the comments in the project itself)

Below are the tests that I have written. This code is present in both spring-jmh-redis and spring-jmh-mongo. This makes the benchmarks more accurate. Read the comments to get a clearer understanding of what the code does.

## System Specifications

Before the results are shown, it is important to see what the hardware specifications are of the machine where the tests are running on:

- CPU: Intel Core i7-12700K
- RAM: 32GB, 3200MHz
- Disk: WD_Black SN850 NVMe
- Motherboard: Gigabyte Z690 UD DDR4
- OS: Windows 10 x64

With these specifications, it is safe to say that the software is not being bottlenecked by the hardware. However, it is likely that the benchmark results will differ on a machine with other specifications. It is important to keep this in mind.

## Results

For each benchmark result, it is displayed what the mode, amount of iterations, score, error margin and time unit is. For each iteration, several operations took place and the average time per operation was calulated. The score you see here, is the average time of all the calculated times of the iterations.

If we look at these results, we can calculate the average read time by taking the average of BM3's results and subtracting the average BM2 result from it:

$$\frac{1471,553+1440,975+1467,443+1472,734+1464,015}{5} - \frac{7,487+7,686+7,340+7,821+7,975}{5} = 1455,682$$

So the amount of time it takes for Redis to write an object is about **1456 microseconds**. The average error margin is about 80 microseconds.

Let's calculate the read time as well. We can calculate the average read time by taking the average of BM6's results and subtracting the average BM5 result from it:

$$\frac{508,009+481,405+483,402+492,332+496,809}{5} - \frac{6,550+6,442+6,496+6,151+6,439}{5} = 485,976$$

So the amount of time it takes for Redis to read an object is about **486 microseconds**. The average error margin is about 24 microseconds.

### MongoDB

BenchmarkTests.ResearchTest.BM6_ReadObject       avgt   20  596,001 Â±  35,009  Î¼s/op
```

If we look at these results, we can already see that the read and write times are a bit different. We can calculate the average read time by taking the average of BM3's results and subtracting the average BM2 result from it:

$$\frac{647,216+660,766+618,857+629,476+664,407}{5} - \frac{3,354+7,310+7,545+7,460+7,752}{5} = 637,4602$$

So the amount of time it takes for MongoDB to write an object is about **637 microseconds**. The average error margin is about 110 microseconds.

Let's calculate the read time as well. We can calculate the average read time by taking the average of BM6's results and subtracting the average BM5 result from it:

$$\frac{569,395+613,367+600,871+607,044+596,001}{5} - \frac{6,526+5,698+5,857+6,063+6,430}{5} = 591,221$$

So the amount of time it takes for Redis to read an object is about **591 microseconds**. The average error margin is about 35 microseconds.


# Conclusion: Which database performs the fastest for a Spring Boot application?

In the benchmarks, the results are quite clear. MongoDB is much faster at writing objects than Redis is, and a bit slower at reading objects than Redis is. MongoDB does have a larger margin of error at the writing times, which means its write times are more inconsistent. Perhaps MongoDB performs worse when the application is under a high workload and has a multi-threaded environment. It doesn't seem likely that Redis will outperform MongoDB in write operations though, especially in large applications, when working in an environment with many billions of records.

It was quite surprising to see MongoDB outperform Redis for write operations. After reading some articles online, I realized that this is most likely because I used Redis as a data store and not as a cache. According to [this article](https://www.mongodb.com/compare/mongodb-vs-redis), Redis can handle millions of requests per second when used as a cache. This means that an operation can take less than a microsecond when implemented properly. This makes it very tempting to use Redis as a cache and MongoDB as a data store. The architecture of the application would then look similar to this:

[![Potential Application Architecture](../Images/potential_application_architecture.jpg)](../Images/potential_application_architecture.jpg)

*In this case, the database would be a MongoDB database.*

It is also possible to use MongoDB as a cache, but Redis is generally faster. In [this article](https://dev.to/playtomic/redis-vs-mongodb-fight-1481) and [this article](https://scalegrid.io/blog/comparing-in-memory-databases-redis-vs-mongodb-percona-memory-engine/), both Redis and MongoDB were used as a cache and were benchmarked. The results are as expected.

Because Redis is often use as a cache and not as a data store, it was quite hard to find benchmarks from other people who did the same experiment I did. From the information gathered, we can safely say that, although Redis' speeds as a data store are still quite fast, MongoDB is better suited as a data store and Redis is better suited for caching.

Other than the choice of database to use as a data store, there are also other factors which could influence read and write speed in a production environment. For example, if you are using databases on a cloud service, you are dependant on the network speed of the cloud service and the hardware they use. Workload and OS optimization are also important factors.

# Summary

In the research, the different types of NoSQL databases were mentioned and explained. Several databases were chosen and its use-cases were explained. Then, Redis and MongoDB were implemented in Spring Boot projects and the same was attempted for ScyllaDB. This was done with the help of available dependincies and Docker. After implementing most databases successfully, they were then benchmarked in seperate projects. This was done successfully with the help of JMH and Spring Boot test. The results were then analyzed and some interesting conclusions were reached. Due to this research, insight was gained, as well as architecture ideas for future projects. Lots of information was gained and the questions were answered successfully. Thank you for reading.
