# Introduction

For this project, I need to choose a suitable database for all of my services. Since all of my services work very similar, I only want to choose one type of database. I will then use multiple instances of that database type for my services.


# My Requirements

## The database needs to be fast

I want my website to be as responsive as possible. It would be a shame if I used a slow database while using such a fast module bundler like Vite. The database must also be able to scale well, in case many people use the website. This is not that much as a requirement though. It is more important that the database is fast than it is scalable.

## The database should be NoSQL

There are multiple reasons why I don't want to use a database with SQL. First of all, SQL databases are generally slower than NoSQL databases. According to a Rochester study, key-value storage databases are especially fast (https://www.cs.rochester.edu/courses/261/fall2017/termpaper/submissions/06/Paper.pdf). Furthermore, it is easier to do scaling when using NoSQL databases. When scaling with SQL databases, you have to migrate to a more expensive server (verticle scaling). When scaling with NoSQL databases, you can just add more cheaper servers (horizontal scaling) (https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained/nosql-vs-sql, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-vs-nosql-which-one-is-better-to-use/). Lastly, I want to use NoSQL, because I have never used a NoSQL database in an individual project before and I would like to gain more experience by using it in this project.


# Database Options

For my database options, I decided it would be good to pick different types of NoSQL databases, to test the theory that key-value databases are the fastest. I have also picked popular databases of each type, which are said to be very fast.

## Redis
*Website: https://redis.com/*

**What type of database is Redis?**

Redis is a type of database known as a key-value database. In a key-value database, data is stored and retrieved using a unique key that identifies the particular item of data. The data (value) associated with a key can be any type of data, such as strings, integers, lists, dates, UUID's and more. Key-value databases are typically very fast and scalable, making them well-suited for applications that require quick access to large amounts of data.

*Data types in Redis*

**In what scenarios is Redis often used?**

Redis is a good option for applications which need to handle lots of small continuous reads and writes. It is more often used as a cache, but can also be used as a data store. It can also store data in-memory, which allows these actions to be done faster. It is also ideal for applications that donâ€™t require frequent updates or need to support complex queries.

Redis is often used for the following use-cases:

- Caching
- Chatting, messaging, and queues
- Gaming leaderboards
- Session store
- Rich media streaming
- Geospatial
- Machine Learning
- Real-time analytics

# Implementation

In this section I will show how to implement these databases to a Spring Boot project. The explanations will assume that there is already a basic API which can handle basic CRUD operations. The instructions on how to install all of the databases are at the end, in the 'Docker Compose File' part of this section.

## Redis Implementation

For Redis, first install these dependencies by putting them in the pom.xml file and then reload the project.
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-redis</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.lettuce</groupId>
  <artifactId>lettuce-core</artifactId>
  <version>6.2.1.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
```

Then add the `@RedisHash` bean to your domain class, and give the hash a name that fits. Then, implement the Serializable class, so that objects of the domain class can be serialized and deserialized by Redis.
```java
// More imports
import org.springframework.data.redis.core.RedisHash;

@RedisHash("Tournament")
public class Tournament implements Serializable {

    @Serial
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 6828938851562689867L;

    // Public enum Status

    @Id
    private UUID id;

    // More properties & constructors, getters and setters.
}
```

After that, go to your repository and make sure it extends the `CrudRepository` class. Then tell this class what type of model it should do CRUD operations with. Also tell it what type of object the primary key in that model is.
```java
// Imports

@Repository
public interface TournamentRepository extends CrudRepository<Tournament, UUID> {

}
```

Then add this configuration class to your project. This configuration class is responsible for connecting with the installed Redis database and serializing domain classes. In this configuration, transactions are enabled.
```java
// Imports

@Configuration
@EnableCaching
@EnableRedisRepositories
public class MainConfiguration {

    @Value("${redis.host}")
    private String redisHostName;

    @Value("${redis.port}")
    private Integer redisPort;

    @Bean
    public LettuceConnectionFactory redisLettuceConnectionFactory() {
        RedisStandaloneConfiguration redisStandaloneConfiguration = new RedisStandaloneConfiguration(redisHostName, redisPort);
        return new LettuceConnectionFactory(redisStandaloneConfiguration);
    }

    @Bean
    public RedisTemplate<byte[], byte[]> redisTemplate() {
        RedisTemplate<byte[], byte[]> redisTemplate = new RedisTemplate<>();
        redisTemplate.setConnectionFactory(redisLettuceConnectionFactory());
        redisTemplate.setKeySerializer(new StringRedisSerializer());
        redisTemplate.setHashKeySerializer(new StringRedisSerializer());
        redisTemplate.setHashKeySerializer(new JdkSerializationRedisSerializer());
        redisTemplate.setValueSerializer(new JdkSerializationRedisSerializer());
        redisTemplate.setEnableTransactionSupport(true);
        redisTemplate.afterPropertiesSet();
        return redisTemplate;
    }
}
```

Lastly, put these environment variables in your application.properties file. It is important to note that the value of `redis.host`, which is `tournament-db-redis`, aligns with the name of the docker container that I will be using that contains a redis instance.
```
redis.host=tournament-db-redis
redis.port=6379
```

Now, the application should be able to write data onto a Redis instance. To test this, you can make a post request to your API.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../Images/postman_post_tournament.png">
</p>

*When making a post request, there is a response from the API.*

Then, we can go into Redis and check if the posted object is saved as intended. You could check this by using the redis-cli, but I prefer using the RedisInsight GUI.

[![Tournament post request](../Images/redisinsight.png)](../Images/redisinsight.png)

*The posted tournament within Redis.*

As you can see, the posted tournament has succesfully been saved in the database.

## MongoDB Implementation

For MongoDB, install this dependency for your project.
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Then go to your model and put the `@Document` annotation above your domain class. This way, the application knows you are trying to use MongoDB's repository, instead of the JPARepository. You can also include the `@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)` annotation to tell the application to remove `null` fields when serializing the class.
```java
// Imports

@Document(collection = "player")
@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)
public class Player {

    // Public static final fields

    @Id
    private UUID id;

    // More properties & constructors, getters and setters.
}
```

In your repository, extend the MongoRepository and insert the domain model class and the type of ID that it has.
```java
// More imports

import org.springframework.data.mongodb.repository.MongoRepository;

@Repository
public interface PlayerRepository extends MongoRepository<Player, UUID> {
}
```

In your application.properties, add these properties and rename some values to something more secure. Again, `player-db-mongo` is referring to a docker container name.
```
spring.data.mongodb.host=player-db-mongo
spring.data.mongodb.authentication-database=admin
spring.data.mongodb.username=admin
spring.data.mongodb.password=password
spring.data.mongodb.database=Player
spring.data.mongodb.port=27017
```

## Scylla Implementation

For Scylla, install these dependencies in your project. With the spring-data-cossandra dependency, you can use the cassandra repositories and connect with a cassandra database. These things will also be useful with the Scylla database. The java-driver-core dependency will allow Java data to be inserted in a Scylla database.
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-cassandra</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.scylladb</groupId>
  <artifactId>java-driver-core</artifactId>
  <version>4.14.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Add the `@Table` and `@PrimaryKey` annotations in your domain class. You can also add the `@Column` annotation to give properties a different name in the database table. In this case, I renamed them because capital letters are automatically lowercased in the database. I like using `snake_case`.
```java
// Imports

@Table(value = "rank")
public class Rank {
    private static final short DEFAULT_RANK_NUMBER = 1;

    @PrimaryKey
    private UUID id;
    @Column("tournament_id")
    private UUID tournamentId;
    @Column("player_id")
    private UUID playerId;
    @Column("rank_number")
    private short rankNumber;
    @Column("points")
    private float points;
    @Column("created_at")
    private LocalDateTime createdAt;

    // Constructors, getters and setters
}
```
In your repository, extend the CassandraRepository and insert the domain model class and the type of ID that it has.
```java
// More imports

import org.springframework.data.cassandra.repository.CassandraRepository;

public interface RankRepository extends CassandraRepository<Rank, UUID> {
}
```

Then add this configuration class to your project. This configuration class is responsible for connecting with Scylla. In this class, it is mentioned that a keyspace in Scylla will be created, if it doesn't already exist. This is very useful, because this will eliminate the need to enter the database and manually create a keyspace.
```java
// Imports

@Configuration
@EnableCassandraRepositories
public class ScyllaConfiguration extends AbstractCassandraConfiguration {

    @Value("${scylla.keyspace}")
    private String keyspace;

    @Override
    protected String getKeyspaceName() {
        return keyspace;
    }

    @Override
    protected List<CreateKeyspaceSpecification> getKeyspaceCreations() {
        final CreateKeyspaceSpecification specification =
                CreateKeyspaceSpecification.createKeyspace(keyspace)
                        .ifNotExists()
                        .with(KeyspaceOption.DURABLE_WRITES, true)
                        .withSimpleReplication();
        return List.of(specification);
    }
}
```

These are the properties and values used for this implementation. As you can see, a schema will also be created if it doesn't already exist.
```
spring.data.cassandra.contact-points=localhost
spring.data.cassandra.port=9042
spring.data.cassandra.local-datacenter=datacenter1
spring.data.cassandra.schema-action=create_if_not_exists
spring.data.cassandra.keyspace-name=rankKeyspace
scylla.keyspace=rankKeyspace
```
